Earlier this year, President Biden executed his brilliantly well thought out plan for the United States to leave Afghanistan. His plan was simple. Take American soldiers out of the country and leave the poorly trained Afghanistan military to fend off the Taliban. [Judging by what experts where saying](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/16/how-afghanistan-fell-to-the-taliban-so-quickly.html), the American government seemed to know (or at least should have known) the Afghans would lose against the Taliban, but seemed disappointed that the Afghans lost quicker than expected. But what is the difference, a loss is a loss. I can only imagine what government officials must have been thinking, _we trained the Afghans so they will spend a month fighting the Taliban and then surrender and be killed_.

Whatever government officials were thinking, it really doesn’t make sense. The entire situation doesn’t make sense. Invade a country and occupy them for [20 years](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/31/1032454975/biden-afghanistan-exit-withdrawal-speech), teach them how to fight against terrorists, then leave the country and let it get overrun by terrorists.

Truly, an economic collapse and other deleterious effects should have been foreseen. President Biden should have even had people predict what would likely happen if the United States left Afghanistan. Fortunately, for the Biden administration, there’s likely not many people paying attention to the news about Afghanistan. Not many people are going to put effort into searching about what’s going on in Afghanistan. Additionally, news outlets don’t stay focused on any one topic for too long. So not many people likely know that the [US’ exit from Afghanistan led to an economic collapse in Afghanistan](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/12/1107132).
