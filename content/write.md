title: Write for Us
---

We are always eager to read and publish articles. Send your article to us or just send us some headlines or ideas and we’ll see what we can do with it.

Our submission policy is simple. Articles should usually be under 1,000 words, should be somewhat sarcastic and opinionated, and should broadly relate to society or politics.

If you’re interested in publishing a series of articles on The Hinged, please send us a writing sample and sample headlines of the articles in the series.

You can send your emails to editors@thehinged.com.
