Bringing a sarcastic and opinionated take to society and politics. We say our opinions on what’s going on to keep you entertained, using headlines such as “Nobody Cares that Kim Jong Un Threatens to Attack the US” and “Anti-Brexit Protestors Realize They’re Wasting Their Time.” Our goal is not to make money, but to grab your attention so we can show you the absurdity that occurs in life.
